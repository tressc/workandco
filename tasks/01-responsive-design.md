The design has 3 breakpoints and a few button and cart states.

Implement to the best of your ability the given design based on the starter boilerplate. Please make your work [responsive, not adaptive](https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-responsive-and-adaptive-design/).

Some designs (like the cart on tablet) are missing. Please implement what you think is best. Hopefully this won't happen in real life, but we want to see how you handle a missing design ðŸ™‚
